<p>How you can run ros_cartographer on kitti dataset</p>
<p>Intorduction</p>
there is tutorial how to run ros_cartographer on kitti dataset. I was suffered from lack of documentation in these libraries and decided to write instructions for making SLAM using google gartographer.
<p>who will this article be usefull for</p>
<ul>
    <li>You work with point clouds and want to make SLAM</li>
    <li>You know what ros is</li>
</ul>

<p>Step one. Installation ros-cartographer.</p>
There is <a href="https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compilation.html">instruction</a>.
before you should install ros. I believe you have already installed ros.
<spoiler title="If not there is small description">
    <ol>
        <li>install cmake and g++</li>
        <li>install vtk from source (for this you have to install openGL, freeglut, etc.)</li>
        <li>install pcl from sorce</li>
        <li>install ros from apt </li>
    </ol>
</spoiler>
After installation it is a good idea check the system. <a href="https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demos.html">Run demo files for cartographer</a>.
If you cant't you have a problem and I can recomend you only reinstall you system . May be it is a good idea install ubuntu 18 if you have ubuntu 16.
<a href="https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer_ros/issues/1192">Possible problem.</a>
<p>Step two. Save data from kitti to bag file.</p>
What data do we need?
<ul>
    <li>Point Cloud in format sensor_msgs/PointCloud2. It is neccecary and should be published by topic "point2" if you have only one lidar. If there are 2 or more lidars topics has to be "point2_1", "point2_2" ....</li>
    <li>Data from imu. Nessesary for 3d. Cartographer use it to define gravity. Should be published in topic "imu" as sensor_msgs/Imu</li>
    <li>gps. should be published in topic "fix" as sensor_msgs/NavSatFix. But it isn't necessary </li>
    <li>odmetry, if you have it published in topic "odom".</li>
    <li>transformation. If you have static transformation like in kitti you can write it in urdf file. If you sensors change position during movement you should publish transformation.</li>
</ul>

I don't be stop at this moment. You can use <a href="https://github.com/oMalyugina/articles/tree/master/kitti2ros/code">my code</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/ethz-asl/kitti_to_rosbag">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tomas789/kitti2bag">two</a>  from github.
I wrote my one only because I don't need calibration, images and Pose in my file.

<p>Step three. Setup ros-cartographer and ru it.</p>
It is the main part of article.

<h4>urdf</h4>
if you go to ../catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/cartographer_ros/urdf/ you find urdf configs. You can write there static position of lidar respectively to robot.
Firstly you describe all sensors which you have like "link".

<spoiler title="Example">
    <code>
        <link name="imu_link">
        <visual>
            <origin xyz="0.0 0.0 0.0" />
            <geometry>
                <box size="0.06 0.04 0.02" />
            </geometry>
            <material name="orange" />
        </visual>
        </link>
    </code>
</spoiler>

I create "base_link" - frame of robot. i will look for transformation between map and base_like. About names you can read <a href="https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html">here</a>.

After it you create elemetn "join" which describe transformation between link's coordinat systems.

<spoiler title="Example">
    <code>
        <joint name="velodyne_joint" type="fixed">
            <parent link="base_link" />
            <child link="velodyne" />
            <origin xyz="0.013 0.005 0.375" rpy="-0.18059 0.10620 -0.65625" />
        </joint>
    </code>

Here you describe your system for cartographer. <a href="https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html"> Documentation from developers</a>.
